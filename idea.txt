Done:
* Just one hit: run the machine for about one rotation of the motor
* run continuously: motor on
* stop: motor off
Intended features:
* count the hits: sense on the motor line when a hit is triggered and increase a counter
** add LCD and display the counter
* display spanker machine setting: determine the duration of the spring loading and thus the setting
* run for a pre-set time: motor on, wait for end of pre-set time, motor off
* run with random delays: random delay, just one hit, repeat
* hits with a constant frequency: fixed delay, just one hit, repeat
* start up delay

Implementation plan:
1. Minimal feature
* one button that toggles motor on/off
* run on bread board and couple with machine

2. One hit
* one button that lets the machine run for one revolution (one hit)

3. Multiple buttons
* One button toggles motor on/off continuosly
* One button lets motor run for just one hit (if it was off)
