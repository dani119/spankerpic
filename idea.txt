Done:
* Just one hit: run the machine for about one rotation of the motor
* run continuously: motor on
* stop: motor off
* added LCD
* added 4x3 keyboard
0. Implement just one hit again: press of '*' runs motor for 1.25 s.

1. Initialise settings with default values
 Implement command '*': start punishment
 Execute punishment
 
Intended features:
* count the hits: sense on the motor line when a hit is triggered and increase a counter
** add LCD and display the counter
* display spanker machine setting: determine the duration of the spring loading and thus the setting
* run for a pre-set time: motor on, wait for end of pre-set time, motor off
* run with random delays: random delay, just one hit, repeat
* hits with a constant frequency: fixed delay, just one hit, repeat
* start up delay

Implementation plan:
1. Minimal feature
* one button that toggles motor on/off
* run on bread board and couple with machine

2. One hit
* one button that lets the machine run for one revolution (one hit)

#3. Multiple buttons
#* One button toggles motor on/off continuosly
#* One button lets motor run for just one hit (if it was off)

========
Function:
After initialisation, display menu and wait for a command.
Commands:
1: show current settings
2: reset settings to default values (delay 3s, 12 hits)
3: store current settings in EEPROM
4: set delay between hits (2 digit number in 0.1 s)
5: set random delay mode (maximum delay as 2 digit number in 0.1 s)
6: set number of hits (2 digit number)
*: start punishment

When punishment is started, count down from 3 to 0. Then display 
number of hits to do and begin with first hit.
After each hit, count down number of hits. If more hits are to come,
wait for the set (possibly random) delay.

Implementation Plan:
0. Implement just one hit again: press of '*' runs motor for 1.25 s.

1. Initialise settings with default values
 Implement command '*': start punishment
 Execute punishment

2. Implement command 1: show current settings

3. Implement command 6: set number of hits

4. Implement command 4: set delay
