Done:
* Just one hit: run the machine for about one rotation of the motor
* run continuously: motor on
* stop: motor off
* added LCD
* added 4x3 keyboard
0. Implement just one hit again: press of '*' runs motor for 1.25 s.

1. Initialise settings with default values
 Implement command '*': start punishment
 Execute punishment
 
2. Implement command 1: show current settings

Intended features:
* run for a pre-set time: motor on, wait for end of pre-set time, motor off
* run with random delays: random delay, just one hit, repeat
* hits with a constant frequency: fixed delay, just one hit, repeat

========
Function:
After initialisation, display menu and wait for a command.
Commands:
1: show current settings
2: reset settings to default values (delay 3s, 12 hits)
3: store current settings in EEPROM
4: set number of hits (2 digit number)
5: set delay between hits (2 digit number in 0.1 s)
6: set random delay mode (maximum delay as 2 digit number in 0.1 s)
*: start punishment

When punishment is started, count down from 3 to 0. Then display 
number of hits to do and begin with first hit.
After each hit, count down number of hits. If more hits are to come,
wait for the set (possibly random) delay.

Implementation Plan:
3. Implement command 4: set number of hits

4. Implement command 5: set delay
